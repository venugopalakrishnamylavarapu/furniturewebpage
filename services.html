            <h1>Hospitaly Design</h1>
            <p>
              This is where the synergy of DECOINC hospitality really comes into
              play. As more businesses introduce flexible working for staff,
              DECOINC increasingly being used as co-working hubs or for meeting
              space. Individuals or small groups visit with their laptops and
              expect to find a space they can plug in and work – hopefully
              spending money on food and drink in the hotel restaurants and
              cafes while they are there. Hotels have seen the profitability in
              this, and so are furnishing these spaces accordingly. Whether the
              space is officially designated as a co-working space, or an area
              that informally encourages people to work there, the thinking
              behind the design is the same. The area needs to provide
              collaborative furniture items such a long bench tables for groups
              to work around, comfortable and supportive seating, plus readily
              accessible power supply for laptop, tablet and smartphone plug in.

            <h1>Residential Design</h1>
            <p>
              Architects have an important job: building structures that will
              fulfil people&#39;s needs while being structurally safe and sound.
              But here&#39;s the thing: you can create the greatest building in
              the world, but nobody&#39;s going to use it if the inside is a
              mess. Interior design is an integral part of architecture, focused
              on creating interior spaces that make the building both functional
              and aesthetically appealing. Still, we have different kinds of
              buildings, so it makes sense that we have different kinds of
              interior designs. One of the biggest arenas for designers
              is residential design, or the interiors of spaces in which people
              live. DECOINC can include houses, apartments, condos, and anywhere
              else where people reside. The architect may build the house, but
              it&#39;s the designer&#39;s job to make it a home.
